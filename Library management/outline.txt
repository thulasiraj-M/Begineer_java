Certainly! Here's a simplified outline of the Library Management System code, along with an explanation of its execution:

1. Importing Required Libraries: The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, such as `java.util.ArrayList`, `java.util.List`, and `java.util.Scanner`, which are used for handling collections, lists, and user input, respectively.

2. Main Method: The `main` method serves as the entry point for the program. It creates an instance of the `Scanner` class to read user input and initializes an empty `ArrayList` to store the books in the library.

3. User Menu: The program runs an infinite loop that displays a menu of options to the user. It provides three choices:
   - Add Book: Allows the user to enter the name of a book and adds it to the `books` list.
   - Display Books: Shows the list of books currently stored in the `books` list.
   - Exit: Allows the user to exit the program.

4. Switch Statement: Inside the loop, a `switch` statement is used to determine the action based on the user's input choice. Depending on the selected choice, the program executes the corresponding case block.

5. Add Book: If the user selects the "Add Book" option, the program prompts the user to enter the name of the book using the `Scanner` object. It then adds the book to the `books` list using the `add()` method and displays a success message.

6. Display Books: If the user chooses the "Display Books" option, the program iterates over the `books` list using a `for-each` loop and prints each book's name.

7. Exit: When the user selects the "Exit" option, the program terminates using the `System.exit(0)` statement, where `0` indicates a successful termination.

8. Loop Continuity: After executing the chosen action, the program continues to display the menu options, allowing the user to make further selections until they choose to exit the program.

9. Error Handling and Resource Cleanup: The code includes error handling using a `try-catch` block to catch any exceptions that may occur during user input. Additionally, the `Scanner` object is closed in the `finally` block to ensure proper resource cleanup.

10. Execution: When the program is run, the user is presented with a menu. They can choose to add a book, display the existing books, or exit the program. The program continuously loops, allowing the user to perform multiple operations until they decide to exit.

That's the simple outline and explanation of the Library Management System code. It provides basic functionality for adding books, displaying them, and exiting the program. You can further enhance this code by adding additional features or error handling based on your requirements.
