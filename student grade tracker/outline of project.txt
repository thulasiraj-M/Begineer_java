Certainly! Here's a simplified outline of the Student Grade Tracker code:

Start by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user.

Ask the user to enter the number of students.

Create an integer array called "grades" with a size equal to the number of students entered.

Use a loop to iterate through each student and prompt the user to enter their grade. Store each grade in the "grades" array.

After all the grades have been entered, display the grades entered by looping through the "grades" array and printing each grade along with the corresponding student number.

Close the Scanner object to release system resources.

This code allows users to input grades for a specified number of students and then displays the entered grades. It provides a basic structure for tracking student grades, which can be expanded upon or customized further based on specific requirements or functionalities.
